<h1>About</h1>
<p>
<div class="lefthalf">
	I am a current 3rd year Electrical Engineering undergraduate at UC San Diego. My interests are in computer systems, signal processing, and circuit design. My goal is to find myself working for a company that wants to improve human living by providing efficient software and quality electrical components that consumers will view as high quality and reliable.
